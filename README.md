# Canvas
Welcome to my Canvas plaything. I intended to use this with a calendar so that the user could write/draw tasks instead of having to type them.
When the user then clicked save, it would save the image to that day.

I am not sure where I will go with this now, maybe another Paint clone.

Feel free to fork and mess with it if youd like.

Current items that work are:
1. Edit names of the tabs.
2. Add a new tab, close a current tab.
3. Saving creates a .png of the tab. Currently stores in the current directory (I think).
4. Change color of the paint brush.
